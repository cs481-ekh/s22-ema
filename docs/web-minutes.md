Items: We discussed about how we will setup our web CI as mentioned by the professor. The whole team is currently working on CI tasks. The objective of today's meeting was to write user stories and related tasks for our sprint 1 goal, which includes the two major stories which needs to be implemented are: NodeJS system needs to be converted to python and to add/remove UI elements (which could be linked up to the backend in the later sprints) according to the project plan. We also discussed how professor wants us to merge the updated changes into the branch as we achieve our sprint goal.
